    <div class="image" id="part1_image"><img src="./World Languages at Rutgers_files/Rutgers_Football.jpg"></div>
    <div class="text" id="part1_text"><p>Rutgers University boasts over 60,000 students, 9,000 faculty members, and 15,000 staff members on the New Brunswick campus alone, not including an additional 450,000 alumni. These numbers, when considered alongside the geographic location of Rutgers, help to create a microcosm of the world right on campus. Deeper analysis of the resulting cultural diversity will reveal linguistic diversity. To begin to understand how languages are represented and function at Rutgers, this study focuses on languages from the all around the world spoken on campus, excluding English. By conducting video-recorded interviews of Rutgers community members who speak these languages, we will gain insight into the relationship between language use and expression of diversity within the University environment. This will be accomplished by collecting the speakers’ thoughts about their interactions, experiences, and identities as bilinguals at Rutgers. At the conclusion of this project, the interviews and research findings will be archived in a multimedia presentation that may be accessed through the Internet. Our project website will serve to provide awareness and information about the languages surveyed as well as their respective cultures. Ultimately, the project will shed light on the importance of foreign language study for the purpose of community building at Rutgers University and lay the groundwork for future research about the function of world language use in a college setting.

    <!--About Us-->
    <div class="title" id="part2_title"><h2>About Us</h2></div>
    <div class="text" id="part2_text">
    <p>The title of our Aresty research project is “World Languages at Rutgers: A Multimedia Web Project”. The research involved pertains to the representation of language at Rutgers, and, by extension, the breadth of Rutgers’ diversity. The research assistants who contributed to this project are Ian Stuart, Bohong Chen, and Emily Ali, all undergraduate students at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. Our professor, Dr. Alexander E. Pichugin, of the Germanic languages department began this project several years ago with the focus being on European languages as they are represented at Rutgers. This year, we have extended our interests to world languages.</p></div>

        <div class="text" id="part3_text">
        <p>In 2016, Rutgers admitted over 1,800 international students, both graduate and undergraduate, to a community already comprised of over 6,000 international students and faculty. They now make up over 11% of our student body, which is a large fraction of the 18% of students that come from out of state. They come from over 120 countries from around the world, with some of the most popular countries being China, India, and South Korea. </p><p>It’s quite clear from these numbers that we have abundant, effectively never-ending resources to learn more about the world through the people around us right here on campus; but how many of us can truly say that we’ve taken advantage of this unique opportunity to understand the diversity of thought, culture, and language that can be observed at Rutgers without even leaving our dorms? </p></div>
        <div class="image2"><img src="./World Languages at Rutgers_files/Diverse_Campus.jpg" alt="Diverse_Campus"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="text2"><p>To discover more about our diverse surroundings as Rutgers students, we conducted video interviews with foreign language speakers who are members of the Rutgers community. This casts a wide net: it includes international students, heritage speakers, and even just those who are passionate about a foreign language without necessarily having a connection to it through ethnicity or heritage. This includes students, both undergraduate and graduate, as well as professors, and other faculty. We asked our participants questions about the languages they speak, the significance of these languages, their implications, and so forth. We then transcribed and coded these video-interviews to analyze them for common themes or ideas between responses from our participants, and ultimately, we compiled the most meaningful parts of the interviews for the public to watch. To more concisely summarize our results (which are composed, in part, of simply a sense of the breadth of diversity at Rutgers), we asked our participants to translate a portion of the Rutgers alma mater into their own target language as closely as they could. We then formatted this portion into a viewable media once again, and organized all of efforts onto the website we created.</p></div>

        <!--Our Findings-->
        <div class="title"><h2>Our Findings</h2></div>
        <div class="image" id="part4_image"><img src="./World Languages at Rutgers_files/Qualitative_Analysis.png" alt="Qualitative_Analysis"></div>
        <div class="text"><p>At the conclusion of our interviews, we established some common themes. One was the dissatisfaction some participants expressed towards the tendency of others to characterize their language as a tool for a career. Another was the intersect of language and culture that exists in countries whose primary language establishes honorifics. After the transcription and coding of these interviews, it was clear that participants identified these as some of their most primary ideas regarding language as we may practically evaluate it today. However, while these specific conclusions hold much significance towards our global understanding of how language affects people, how we interpret language, and what shortcomings we have in our interpretations, they still do not fully speak to a major goal of this project, which was to highlight the diversity of the Rutgers community. Throughout our interviews, we spoke to participants of myriad different backgrounds, each with a unique perspective on how language has shaped them individually. These perspectives, though we may not always realize it, are extremely valuable to understanding how a system of speaking affects a system of thinking, how words affect meaning, and so on and so forth. When we learn about the way people speak, we in turn learn about the way they think, and how they view the world. This not only fosters a better understanding of the people whose thoughts we now begin to appreciate, but also provides us with a new way of viewing our lives, in some ways, as a member of that language, of that set of connotations, feelings, meanings. The next time we encounter a phenomena we once observed using only our own words, we now have the ability to use a different word, this time with the potential to assign that phenomena an entirely new meaning. </p></div>
